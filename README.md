# Genetic Determinants
Genetic algorithm to find scalar coefficients for vectors in a matrix, in order to identify the linear combination which describes the possible null determinant.

## Background

In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

A linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of x and y would be any expression of the form ax + by, where a and b are constants). The concept of linear combinations is central to linear algebra and related fields of mathematics.

The determinant is a value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It can be viewed as the scaling factor of the transformation described by the matrix.
